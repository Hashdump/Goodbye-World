int main(){
    printf( The snow glows white 
    on the mountain tonight
    Not a footprint to be seen
    A kingdom of isolation
    and it looks like Im the Queen
    The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
    Couldnt keep it in
    Heaven knows Ive tried

    Dont let them in
    dont let them see
    Be the good girl you always have to be
    Conceal dont feel
    dont let them know
    Well now they know

    Let it go let it go
    Cant hold it back anymore

    Let it go let it go
    Turn away and slam the door
    I dont care
    what theyre going to say
    Let the storm rage on
    The cold never bothered me anyway

    Its funny how some distance
    Makes everything seem small
    And the fears that once controlled me
    Cant get to me at all

    Its time to see what I can do
    To test the limits and break through
    No right no wrong no rules for me
    Im free

    Let it go let it go
    I am one with the wind and sky
    Let it go let it go
    Youll never see me cry
    Here I stand
    And here Ill stay
    Let the storm rage on

    My power flurries through the air into the ground
    My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
    And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
    Im never going back the past is in the past

    Let it go let it go
    And Ill rise like the break of dawn
    Let it go let it go
    That perfect girl is gone
    Here I stand
    In the light of day
    Let the storm rage on

    The cold never bothered me anyway );
